      <p><em>Note: There is a test repo and overv.io <a href="https://overv.io/madiflannery/proj_management_test/">here</a>. Feel free to use this as a playground for any of the concepts mentioned below.</em></p>

<p>Overv.io is a layer that sits on top of Git, allowing for easy management of issues. The idea: for each feature or bug, an issue is created on an appropriate git repo. Each issue can be assigned to a person, and has tags which are used to keep track of what it is (e.g. 'enhancement' or 'bug'), what its status is (e.g. 'in progress', 'in test'), and other miscellaneous things (e.g. 'question', 'duplicate', 'urgent', etc). Each issue can also be associated with a 'milestone', which is just a collection of issues for a particular release. Each milestone can have a date of when it should be completed by. If an issue isn't assigned to a milestone, it by default lives in the 'backlog'. </p>

<h3>
<a id="the-overvio-interface" class="anchor" href="#the-overvio-interface" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The overv.io interface</h3>

<p>A project home page will by default show the 'board' - this is where all the issues live. You can see that the issues are split into their respective milestones. If a milestone has a due date, it will be displayed next to it's name. Issues with no photo on the left are unassigned. Anything highlighted in light yellow is assigned to you. Each issue also has the name, the issue number, who created the issue, how long ago it was created, and any labels/tags for that issue. </p>

<p>The same issues can also be accessed from github directly <a href="https://github.com/madiflannery/proj_management_test/issues">here</a></p>

<p></p>

<h3>
<a id="flow" class="anchor" href="#flow" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Flow</h3>

<p>You'll also see that there are 4 different statuses an issue can have. These are known as swim lanes. This is like the 'life cycle' for the issue.
1. New - this is where issues start. Work hasn't commenced on them yet, and they may be unassigned.
2. In progress - work has commenced on the issue, whoever is working on it should assign it to themselves. Issues can't be assigned to multiple people, so I propose that we either leave them unassigned (and potentially put whose working on it in the comments), or assign it to whoever is doing the majority of the work (open to suggestions on this). 
3. Ready for test - as the name suggests, this means the issue is done but needs to be tested. Note that this may not apply to every issue, but is there if it's needed.
4. Closed - this means the issue is completed and tested.</p>

<p>To change the status of an issue, just click and drag it to the appropriate lane (making sure you don't drag it between milestones!).</p>

<h3>
<a id="labels" class="anchor" href="#labels" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Labels</h3>

<p>Each issue should be labelled appropriately so it's easy to track its status. The labels are shown in the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you move issues through the swim lanes, the appropriate labels will be added/removed.
The other commonly used labels will be 'enhancement', which is used to say an issue is a feature, and 'bug', which is used to say an issue is a bug. The labels 'urgent' and 'low priority' can be used to give extra info about timeframes.</p>

<h3>
<a id="milestones" class="anchor" href="#milestones" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Milestones</h3>

<p>Milestones are a collection of issues for a particular release (e.g. v4.1). Each milestone can have a date of when it should be completed by (this is optional). If an issue isn't assigned to a milestone, it by default lives in the 'backlog', which is generally where issues will be taken from to form a new release/milestone.</p>

<p>Note that a milestone doesn't necessarily have to be a release - it could just be a collection of tasks you want done by a particular date (e.g. issues you want fixed before GCC). Most often they are releases though.</p>

<p>All milestones can be viewed by clicking on 'milestones' on the left hand side of the screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>They can also be viewed in github by going issues -&gt; milestones (see <a href="https://github.com/madiflannery/proj_management_test/milestones">here</a>).</p>

<p></p>

<a id="editing-an-existing-issue--adding-comments" class="anchor" href="#editing-an-existing-issue--adding-comments" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Editing an existing issue / adding comments</h3>

<p>To edit an existing issue, click on it's name. You'll then see something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The main part shows the "history" of the issue - previous labels, who it's been assigned to, and most importantly, the description and comments associated with the issue. 
The right hand side shows the issue status, the labels currently associated with it, the milestone and who it's currently assigned to. To change any of these, click on the little icon above it. To edit the description, hover just next to the close button, and the edit icon will pop up for you to click on.
To comment on the issue, just type in the box and click 'comment'. Markdown is supported, and you can also add images and documents.</p>

<p>You can also edit or comment on the issue in git directly</p>

<p></p>

<a id="reporting-a-new-issue-or-requesting-a-new-feature" class="anchor" href="#reporting-a-new-issue-or-requesting-a-new-feature" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reporting a new issue or requesting a new feature</h3>

<p>To add a new issue, click the + button in the bottom right hand corner. You can also click the + button next to the appropriate milestone name or the backlog. You'll get something that looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>At least, an issue must have a title and be assigned to a milestone or the backlog. Check you're adding it to the right repo. You should label the issue as either an enhancement or bug, and add any additional labels as required (e.g. 'urgent'). Optionally, you can choose who it's assigned to, and add a description. </p>

<p>You can also add a new issue in git, by clicking <a href="https://github.com/madiflannery/proj_management_test/issues">issues</a> in the main repo page, and then 'add new issue'.</p>

<p><em>Note: when adding issues, check that you're adding it to the right repo!</em></p>

<h3>
<a id="creating-a-new-milestone" class="anchor" href="#creating-a-new-milestone" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a new milestone</h3>

<p>To create a new milestone, you can either hover over the + button in the bottom right hand corner then click the signpost icon, or click "milestones" in the sidebar, followed the big + button.</p>

<p>You'll get something that looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Providing a name is mandatory, description and due date are optional.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hate-it" class="anchor" href="#hate-it" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hate it?</h3>

<p>This is the best part about using git issues - all the data lives on git, so if you hate overv.io you can use git directly, or another git issues management tool of your choice (e.g. waffle.io) - just ensure it's set up identically to our setup so things don't get messy.</p>
